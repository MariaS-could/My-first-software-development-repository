# My-first-software-development-repository
This software repository contains my first software for the module Software Development. It stores all related files including a README file which contains information about the software I have written.
## About Me

I am a computer science student who is currently learning software developer: the fundamentals of software development.
So far, I have learned the importance of version control and how GitHub allows developers
to track changes, work with branches, and collaborate safely without affecting the main codebase.

Versioning helps ensure that software changes can be tested and reviewed before being merged.
